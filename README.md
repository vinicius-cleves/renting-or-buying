# Should I rent or buy a house?

[[website](https://share.streamlit.io/vinicius-cleves/renting-or-buying/main/app.py)]

I see a lot of people playing cool advocating that renting is a better finantial decision than buying. Naturally, this decision depends on lots of variables. This app simulates possible cenarios considering some of those variables. 

PS: This is not financial advice. 

Check the app on: https://share.streamlit.io/vinicius-cleves/renting-or-buying/main/app.py

### Run locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinicius-cleves/renting-or-buying.git

cd renting-or-buying

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py 
```
